Used conda venv in this project.
Since it used mediapipe, which requires py3.11


To activate conda venv: (ALL future mediapipe project can use this!)
conda activate myenv_3_11


To install:
conda install <package_name>     //mediapipe
or
pip install       //also worked:  3.11.11


Hand Ideas:
    Color Change: The background color will shift based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.
    Sound Effects: Different distances will trigger different sound pitches.
    Emoji Display: If the hand forms certain angles or distances, an emoji will appear on the screen.
